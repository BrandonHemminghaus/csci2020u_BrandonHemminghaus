1. Want my application does that is shows all text files in a given folder. The info shown in the file name,
   the class of the folder and the spam probability
2. One improvement that I made was to make the layout nicer. I used setMinWidth to make the width of the window 
   bigger, so all the info is shown.
3. To run the application just ctrl+f5 on the main.java file or click the run button
4. I used passed lab assignments to helped to me with this assignment. Watch the videos on module 4 for extra
   help because I don't have a lot of experience with javaFx.
