a. This project was a file sharing server. A client would interact with a server to upload
   and download from the server
b. No improvements were made
c. To run the project, click the run button at the very top of the taskbar and click "Run Main". 
   If the UI isn't showing, go to "Edit configurations" to make the Client class contain the
   main method. Just change sample.Main to sample.Client
d. I looked at the module 7 videos and sample code for help
